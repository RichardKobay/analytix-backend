And thanks for all the great musicians who inspire me everyday. Thank you. I love music,01/08/2015 05:35
So fans shouldn't have to choose. Music is about sharing and lifting eachother up. I love music for what it can do for us. Much love,01/08/2015 05:34
When it comes to music we shouldn't be put up against eachother. Music isn't about competition it is about collaboration. It's a language,01/08/2015 05:33
